## Ex. 0
Modernize the JavaScript file found in ~/students/Lab/modern-js.js.  Replace the legacy functions with arrow functions and replace var with either let or const.  There's a function signature that isn't right. Can you find it and fix it?
When you are finished, place this file in your student directory and submit a PR.

## Ex. 1
Create an arrow function called `countNumbers` that takes an array and
returns the number of numbers that only contain decimal points.
When you are finished submit a PR.

Usage:
``````````````````````````````````````
const array = [1, '2', 3, 'test', 1.2];
console.log(countNumbers(array));
``````````````````````````````````````

Output:
``````
1
````````

## Ex. 2
Create an arrow function called `minNumber` that takes an array of numbers and
returns the lowest number.  The function must use a for loop and must ignore data types that are of type string or boolean.
When you are finished submit a PR.

Usage:
````````````````````````````````````````
const array = [12, 55, "2", 22, 11, true];
console.log(minNumber(array));
````````````````````````````````````````

Output:
```````
11
```````

## Ex. 3
Create an arrow function named: shortestString that returns the shortest string from an array of strings:
When you are finished submit a PR.

Usage:
````````````````````````````````````````````
array = ['this', 'is', 'a', 'test', 'happy'];
console.log(shortestString(array));
````````````````````````````````````````````

Output:
```````
a
```````



## Ex. 4
Create an arrow function named: countLetters that counts the number of letters from an array of words:
When you are finished submit a PR.

Usage:
```````````````````````````````````````
let array = ["this", "is", "a", "test"];
console.log(countLetters(array));
```````````````````````````````````````

Output:
``````
11
``````



## Ex. 5
Create an arrow function named: countIt that counts the number of integer numbers, decimal numbers and strings from an array.  The countIt function returns nothing and writes output to the terminal.
This arrow function calls the following arrow functions:

countIntegerNumbers
countStrings
countDecimalNumbers

When you are finished submit a PR.

Usage:
``````````````````````````````````````````````````
let array = ["this", "is", 1, 3, 2.1, "a", "test"];
countIt(array));
``````````````````````````````````````````````````

Output:
```````````````````````````
Number of Integers: 4
Number of Decimal Numbers: 2
Number of Strings: 4
